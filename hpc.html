					<h2>Problem</h2>
						<p>I've always been fascinated by the invisible challenges in computer systems. Here's a puzzle that's been driving me crazy: how do we make computer systems run smoothly when processing times are about as predictable as weather forecasts? Traditional scheduling methods fall apart when workloads start to dance around unpredictably. It's like trying to organize a perfectly timed relay race where runners keep changing their speed mid-race. The result? Wasted resources, frustrating delays, and systems that never quite hit their full potential.</p>

						<h2>Approach</h2>
						<ol>
							<li><b>Deep Dive into Scheduling Policies</b></li>
							<p>I started by becoming a detective of scheduling algorithms. SRPT, SERPT - these weren't just acronyms, they were my new puzzle pieces. I wanted to understand how these strategies behave when the system throws them curveballs.</p>
							<li><b>Building a Digital Simulation Lab</b></li>
							<p>Time to get hands-on. I created a simulation framework that's essentially a stress test for scheduling strategies. Think of it like a wind tunnel for computer systems, where I could deliberately introduce chaos and see how different approaches respond.</p>
							<li><b>Performance Forensics</b></li>
							<p>The real challenge was mapping out how tiny estimation errors ripple through a system. I meticulously tracked how even small miscalculations in processing times could create massive performance bottlenecks.</p>
							<li><b>Machine Learning Refinement</b></li>
							<p>This wasn't about creating a perfect solution, but a adaptive one. I used machine learning to iteratively improve our scheduling strategies, teaching the system to get smarter with each simulation.</p>
						</ol>

					<section id="Challenges and Lessons Learned" class="main">
						<h2>Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
						<ol>
							<li><b>Taming the Chaos of Variability</b></li>
							<p>Trying to measure unpredictability is like trying to catch smoke with a net. I had to design experiments so precise that they could isolate the tiniest behavioral nuances in system performance.</p>
							<li><b>Computational Marathon</b></li>
							<p>Running large-scale simulations felt like training for an extreme mental marathon. My code needed to be so optimized that it could run complex scenarios without burning through computational resources.</p>
							<li><b>Decoding System Mysteries</b></li>
							<p>The biggest challenge? Understanding the secret language of how scheduling decisions actually impact system performance. It was like learning to read a completely new, incredibly complex dialect.</p>
